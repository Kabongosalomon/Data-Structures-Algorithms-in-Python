# Data-Structures-Algorithms-in-Python
This folder, contains some of my investigation on Data Structures and Algorithms. 

## Project Instructions

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
	
	```	
		git clone https://github.com/Kabongosalomon/Data-Structures-Algorithms-in-Python.git
		cd Data-Structures-Algorithms-in-Python
	```
## Linked List 

There isn't a built-in data structure in Python that looks like a linked list. Thankfully, it's easy to make a classe that can represent a Linked List in Python!

## Stack

Here we make our own _Stack class_ to see how a stack really works under the hood.

## Queue

We will make a Queue class using a list.


## Binary Tree
We will make our own class that implement binary tree and some of it's basic operations

### Binary Search Tree
A more specific type of binary tree, where every element in the left is smaller than element in the right. We wrote a class than will simulate this notion and run basic operations on this type of tree.
